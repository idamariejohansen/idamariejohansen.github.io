# Power BI People Dashboard and Employee Survey
## Overview
This repository contains a Power BI project with interactive dashboards and survey data related to employee information. The project is divided into three pages:
1. **People Dashboard**:
    - Provides general information about employees, including details on departments, headcount, seniority, age, generations, attrition status, gender, performance ratings, education fields, years since the last promotion, and training completed last year.
    - Users can sort and explore this data by clicking on different variables.
  2. **Employee Survey**:
    - Presents survey results related to environment satisfaction, job satisfaction, work-life balance, job environment, and relationships.
    - Ratings are on a scale of 1 to 4.
    - Users can further filter survey data based on generations, attrition status, gender, position, and department.

     3. **Attrition Influencers**:
    - This page showcases key factors influencing attrition (where attrition is marked as “yes”).
    - It provides insights into why employees leave the organization.
Feel free to explore the dashboards and gain valuable insights from the data!
